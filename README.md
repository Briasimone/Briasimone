Hi, i'm @Briasimone or just Bria. I'm interested in all things front-end developement, 
mainly web design(but, I love it all). I'll probably begin exploring the backend at some point. I've learned HTML, CSS, and some JS, so i'm eager to  
perfect my skills, contribute to some projects, and possibly get feedback on my own personal projects. I'm particularly interested in 
projects that will expose me to new languages/software that i'll encounter in my field.
